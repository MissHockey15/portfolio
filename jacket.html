        <p class="milli"> With the crazy success of the 2017’s remake of Stephen Kings’ IT I wanted to create a poster to showcase the film. </p>

        <p class="milli">Along with all the ideas I got while brainstorming ideas I made connections of the film to several other books, films and games. In my research I found a common connection between the movie and one of my favourite video games entitled Little Nightmares. Although two completely different horror stories they each have a child that sports a yellow jacket. </p>

        <p class="milli">With this knowledge I tried to see if any pieces of entertainment of the similar genera had a character with a yellow jacket. With my research I came up with Tim Burtons’ 2009 film Coraline. With this book, videogame and movie in mind I created three yellow jackets with different props in each poster to tell three different stories.</p>
