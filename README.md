Every video game has its own style, its own feel, its own tale. Every movie has its own joy, its own horrors, its own mysteries. How we choose which story we want to be a part of is largely based on the art work that we see on the cover of cases, in stores, and on the web.

These eye catching works guided my love of making posters and selling brands. Taking popular pieces of media and throwing my own illustrative spin on it has helped me become the designer I am today. Creating clever products to help bring people into a story is what I strive to achieve.
