        <p class="milli">Video games are the reason I got into graphic design.  In my spare time I would make posters to advertise my favourite games, I never realized where this pastime would take me. Over the years I have learned how to make my pencil sketches come alive by using different mediums, these designs are now more than 2 dimensional sketches on paper.</p>

        <p class="milli">When I get into a new game it inspires new ideas and provides me opportunities for sketching. Since the release of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo has introduced many Mario games which gave me many new inspirations. There are so many different ways to represent this game and still have it recognizable to everyone, not just gamers.</p>
