        <p class="milli">Video games were the reason I got into graphic design. In my spare time I would make posters to advertise my favourite games without really knowing where else I could take it. Over the years I have learnt how to apply these designs to many different mediums and not just on paper. Because video games are so popular </p>

        <p class="milli">When I get into a new game it provides may new opportunities for sketching and idea making. Since the release of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo has introduced many Mario games which introduced many new inspirations. There are so many different ways to represent this game and have it still be recognizable by everyone, and not just gamers.</p>
